## Step 1: Install Python
Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.8 or later). Download it from the official site if needed:
- [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Check installation by running in Command Prompt (CMD):
```python
python --version
```
## Step 2: Install `uv` via PowerShell
Open PowerShell and run:
```bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```
It looks like you've successfully installed `uv` on your Windows system. The installation path is C:\Users\eshop\.local\bin, and the final step is to add this path to your system's environment variables so that you can run uv from anywhere in the command line

## Using the GUI (Graphical User Interface)
#### Step 1: Open Environment Variables
- Press `Win + s`, type `advanced system settings`, and press **Enter**.
- Click the "Environment Variables..." button at the bottom.
- In **System variables**, find the `Path` variable.
- Select `Path` and click **Edit**...

#### Step 2: Add the New Path
- Click **New** and add the following path:
```bash
C:\Users\kh\.local\bin
```
- Click **OK** to close all windows.

## Step 3: Restart the Terminal
After adding the path, restart **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**, then type:
```bash
uv --version
```
If it displays the version, the installation was successful.
